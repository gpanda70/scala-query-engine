# Scala Query Engine
This project is a Scala implementation of [How Query Engines Work](https://howqueryengineswork.com/00-introduction.html) by Andy Grove.
The book uses Kotlin, but since I use Scala at work, I want to leverage my existing knowledge.

In the future, I want to review a Rust implementation of this project for learning purposes.
